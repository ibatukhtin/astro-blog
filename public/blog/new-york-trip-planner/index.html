            <p>But it's not just about pizza or parks. What makes AI, and in turn, our special New York trip planner, truly magical is how it can think of so many things at once. Think of it as a jigsaw puzzle. Each piece is a bit of information - your favorite food, the best times to visit places, even what the weather will be like. AI puts all these pieces together to create the perfect picture (or plan) for your New York trip.</p>
