            <li><strong>Historical Heart</strong>: Manchester's age-old Roman hub.</li>
            <li><strong>Original Name</strong>: Once called "Mamucium", meaning 'breast-shaped hill'.</li>

A walk along the old canals will offer you views of narrowboats gently floating by, sometimes with melodies of live music wafting from nearby bars.</p>
            <p>One of Castlefield's jewels is the <a href="https://bridgewatercanal.co.uk/">Bridgewater Canal</a>, lovingly dubbed England's first 'true' canal. On a sunny day, you'll find locals and tourists sitting by its banks, feeding ducks, or just enjoying the tranquil vibe.</p>
